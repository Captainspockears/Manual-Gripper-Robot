# Manual-Gripper-Robot
The code that I used for the manual bot that I built for the International Robotics Challenge, Techfest 2018, IIT Bombay. It is a remote controlled bot that can lift and place objects.

### [Arduino 1](arduino_1.ino)
Controls four DC motors with a joystick. These motors are connected to the wheels of the robot for movement.

### [Arduino 2](arduino_2.ino)
Controls the servo motor that is used to rotate the gripper arm and the DC motor that converges and diverges the gripper arms
